<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
You are now using a set of extensions designed to work with the CDC
<b>PHIN-MS</b> secure messaging system.  At the top of each page 
you will find a set of navigation buttons that provide the following:
<ul class="button">
  <li>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a> - shows this page
  </li>
   <li>
    <a href="dashboard.html">Dash Board</a> - an overview of PHIN-MS activity and
    status.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="queues.html">Queues</a> - comprehensive details for
    <b>PHIN-MS</b> message queues.  
    <p>
    It consists of three sections.  On the 
    right you will find a list of queues and either (sender) routes 
    or (received) party ID's constraints for the selected queue.  Click
    on any of these links to modify the displayed rows.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the left side is a table of rows for the selected queue and (optional)
    constraint.  Each row provides a few details about that
    item.  Below the table there may be <b>Next</b> and/or <b>Previous</b>
    buttons that can be used to display additional rows
    </p>
    <p>
    The bottom section contains details about the row selected from the
    record table described above.  Selection is made by the <b>recordId</b>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="status.html">Status</a> -  status of the previous several
    messages handled by the <b>PhinmsX</b> receiver.
  </li>
</ul>
